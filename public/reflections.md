## Q1 End of Lessons Reflection
### by Summer Guevarra 9-NA


### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. The topic of Javascript variables are all about learning what each keyword means and when it is used, it also teaches how to properly name your variables. Some examples of JS variables are var, let and const. 

2. The topic of Event handlers teaches how to make your web pages interactive. This is by coding a function in HTML that responds to the users action in your website. An example of this is coding a button in HTML and when interacted with, it shows something new. 

3. The topic of Function declaration is similar to the topic of variable declaration. When we declare a function, it goes through the same process as declaring a variable. It keeps track of data, return type, and parameters. This tells the computer what task it will do and what input and output value it uses. Function declarations help organize by defining reusable blocks of code.

4. The topic of processing function output, specifically using the return statement teaches how to instruct the function to pass the value of the variable to outside of the function and return to where the function is called. It is also used to break statements to end the process of the code before all lines inside the function are executed. 

5. The topic of Data types are data descriptions, there are six fundamental data types: strings, numbers, Boolean, null, undefined, and Symbol. Strings are used with text, like names or messages. Numbers are for any numerical value, like age, scores, or prices. Booleans represent true or false values, often used for conditions in code. Null is used when a variable is given no value, and undefined is used when a variable has been created but no value has been given to it yet. Lastly, symbols are mainly used when we need specific identifiers that wonâ€™t match with anything else. 

### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.
1. I need further practice in loop control structures because it is a long proccess of code. I want to be able to swiftly understand and make a code without struggle. 

2. I need further discussion in JS operations because I somewhat struggle/overthink what the operations mean all together. I have no trouble understanding each type of operator individually but when it comes to combining all of them, I'm confused on how to understand/interpret it.

3. I need further practice in processing function outputs. Though it is a straightforward concept to understand, I still am not confident if I could make one of my own without support. 

4. I need further practice in printing shapes with asterisks as I haven't fully wrapped my head around the topic. Specifically on which variable moves the asterisks down and which variable moves the asterisks side to side.

5. I need further practice in debugging. The given code in the graded excerise that was used to debug was a little too complex for me. Other than the simple errors like a missing semi-colon and wrong operators, I struggled to find what else to debug. 

### Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
My plan of action in order to help myself in understanding further the topics I listed is to review the khub LGs, watch videos about it, and practice what I've learned. If I have questions, I could also ask my teacher or fellow peers.

### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
Two activities that I think were really effective are recitation and in-class coding. Recitation helps a lot as it reflects your understanding of the topic being teached, and in-class coding helps a lot as it lets me experience how to do the code and understand it better. I find none of the activities done in class ineffective, as it all helped me build up my knowledge now. (Thank you sir Roy!)
