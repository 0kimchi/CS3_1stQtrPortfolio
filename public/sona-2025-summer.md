## Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.
### by Summer Guevarra 9-NA


1. Some key points from the SONA 2025 that I found interesting are the solar powered houses and the start of easy and efficient transportation by building good quality bridges. 


2. Some key points from the SONA 2025 I found weird were the 20 peso rice in this economy.


3. In this year’s SONA, a lot of promising statements were made. Mainly about accessible and free healthcare services and medicine, the betterment of infrastructures/facilities and quality academics. Though technological advancements like solar powered houses and better free wifi, load and laptops would be given to teachers. Also, events like the walang gutom program and trust fund to coconut farmers will be implemented further.

Personally, I think these ideas and plans are indeed necessary to our country right now. Though I’d like more emphasis on better sewage/drainage systems to minimize such big floods. Rehabilitating squatters and homeless to better homes to maximize the usage of the area they take up; or give better opportunities to people in provinces and non-urban areas. However, all of this comes down to a lack of funding for such programs or plans like these to be implemented. 

>4. Very promising
